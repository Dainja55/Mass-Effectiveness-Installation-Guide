# Intro

### Mass Effectiveness

Mass Effectiveness blah blah [Life in the Ruins](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=life_in_the_ruins).

Is Mass Effectiveness for you?

**Please read this guide in its entirety.**

**Please read the FAQ again before reporting an issue or asking me a question.**

## Installation

---

### Pre-Installation

You need a legal copy of Mass Effect Legendary Edition through Steam or Origin

These steps are only for installing this Modlist for the first time. If you are updating the Modlist, go to [Updating](#updating).

---

### Steam and Origin Configs

If you're installing Origin for the first time I recommend choosing these settings; however, you can change this in the Origin launcher too.

#### Change Steam's Update Behavior

To ensure that Steam does not automatically update the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

#### Change Origin's Update Behavior

To ensure that Origin does not automatically update the game for you, 

#### Set the Game Language to English in Steam

Right click Mass Effect Legendary Edition > properties > language > select English from the dropdown menu.

#### Set the Game Language to English in Origin



#### Note on Localization

I'm not really sure how to localize, you guys are totally up to it if you can. This Modlist is in English and so are 99% of all mods made for Mass Effect LE. I think the most compatible, or only compatible, way to play the game is to have it be in English. I'm also not sure how region lock effects the game, but I personally don't think it should be an issue, except for countries that basically ban freedom of thought.

#### Disable the Steam Overlay

**I will not give support to people with a non-English game**. I liked to if could, but it simply isn't feasible.

#### Clean Mass Effect Legendary Install

I absolutely recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You also need to delete the `Mass Effect Legendary Edition` folder in `Documents/My Games/BioWare`. **Make sure you run the game once** to establish your registry path - otherwise, Wabbajack will be unable to locate the game directory, and you won't be able to download the mods :(.

#### Backing Up Main LE Installation From Your Library

For Steam, right click on Mass Effect Legendary Edition > Manage > Browse Local Files > right click "Game" > copy to a folder of your choice, but I recomend `c:/WJ/Vanilla Game Backups`

For Origin

### Using Wabbajack

---

#### Preparations

Let's get to the actual installation..

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) (just click the big blue Download button). Place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as `C:/Wabbajack`. Please do not put it in a Windows Protected Directory, such as Program Files or your Desktop. If you're using Windows 11, do this to give yourself admin permissions for `C:/Wabbajack` folder you created in your `C drive`.

Launch Wabbajack. The exe will download the rest of the program from Github and extract itself wherever you placed the exe. When it is finished extracting and installing itself, select the `Browse Modlists` option. Click the Download arrow for Magnum Opus, and you will be forwarded to the next screen when it is finished.

Set the `Installation Location` to a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as `D:\Magnum Opus`. The `Download Location` will update automatically. Again, please avoid using Windows Protected Directories.

Click the `Play` arrow. If you have a Nexus Premium account, all of your downloads will be automated. Without Premium, you will need to manually click the Download button for each mod. Installation will be automated regardless of your account status.

### Manual Downloads

Some mods for MELE only have manual download links. Sorry, you'll have to download these manually. Place them in the Downloads folder within the Mass Effectiveness modpack folder that wabbajack created. (example: c:/wj/mass effectiveness/mo2/downloads)

### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.
